This is an exercise in structuring my configuration and learning more elisp.

Some of the goals I have for this exercise include

1) Minimal calls to external package repositories from elpa and melpa and
   maximize the use of Emacs' builtin packages
2) Portability between OSs and systems
3) Improving the UI and interaction schema for Emacs.
   - Part of this is my custom theme. Rule of thumb here is to minimize
     definition of custom faces. Only customize a face if it doesn't adhere to a
     theme principles or doesn't know how to inherit from default Emacs faces.
   - A more modern(? To be defined) way of interacting with the mini-buffer.
   - Child-frames for completions ala posframe.
   - Adding context where possible.
   - Providing easy access to help & documentation.

* Progress
- [X] Bare-bones setup to build from.
- [X] Bare-bones recreation of [[https://github.com/skye-repos/TransSide-theme][my old theme]] =TransSide-Theme=.
- [-] Simple mode-line.
  - [ ] Git version details
  - [X] Custom RO Indicator
  - [X] File name and buffer mode indicator
- [ ] Remove leaf.el. The added syntactic consistency is great, but use-package
  is more standard. Alternatively, Can be more explicit with all
  configurations and avoid macros entirely
- [ ] A quick script to install fonts and libenchant in a programmatic manner
- Consider the following functionality
  - [ ] Treating the mini-buffer as a ephemeral child frame.
  - [ ] Quick help mode
    - [ ] Emacs in general
    - [ ] Org-mode specifically
  - [ ] Dashboard
          
* Installation
1) Install libenchant. [[https://github.com/minad/jinx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][You can follow the instructions here.]]
2) Install the font =0xProto=. You can set your own font through the =thetasigma-font= custom variable.

Then just git clone into the =user-emacs-directory=. I like =~/.config/emacs= though any folder recognized by the XDG config specification should work.

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/skye-repos/thetasigma-emacs.git ~/.config/emacs
#+end_src

You can launch Emacs now (or restart the daemon) and it should work. The first
start may take a bit to pull in all the packages (will be minimized eventually)

* Usage Notes
Any emacs-lisp fill you put in one of the following directories will automatically be loaded by Emacs.
Also note that package.el will not be available in early-init.el or scripts in =preload/=.

1) =0-preload/= - loaded by early-init.el
2) =1-main/= - loaded in init.el
3) =2-user/= - loaded last

You can place your own configurations in the thetasigma-user directory.

I'm also working on a light-mode theme which you can try out with =M-x load-theme thetasigma-light=
